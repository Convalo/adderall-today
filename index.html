      <h2><strong>ADDERALL TODAY, ADDICTION TOMORROW</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/?s=Adderall">Adderall</a> could very well be the least understood prescription drug available to the public today. Not only is Adderall today prescribed to children and young people who still use the drug well into their adult lives, these individuals are also given no provisions or guidelines as to how they wean themselves away from Adderall in order to live a substance-free life.</p>
<p>Adderall today is prescribed to alleviate two overriding ailments that can be found in any young person, the first being Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), while the second is narcolepsy. </p>
<p>And while Adderall has been successful in treatment of both ailments in young people, patients still use the drug far into their adult life, which in the field of rehab, can signal that a full-blown addiction is occurring.</p>
<p>One question that should arise from the nearly 4 million prescriptions written yearly for Adderall is what will be the long-term implications of the drug? How will it affect the user the longer they are on it? Additionally, what alternative treatments are there that can treat a patient without the fear of them becoming addicted?</p>

        <h2><strong>ADDERALL WAS SUPPOSED TO HELP ME, WASN&rsquo;T IT?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes, in all truthfulness, your pediatrician at one time prescribed Adderall to you because, quite frankly, you were all over the place.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t concentrate. Your grades at school suffered from it, and your folks were both terrified and desperate. They wanted you to get better, so of course they went for the doctor&rsquo;s recommendation.</p>
<p>Little did you, your parents or even your doctor realize that since your teen years and all <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/blog/substance-abuse-studies">through college</a> to what is now your career, you&rsquo;ve been taking Adderall for an existing ailment (ADHD or narcolepsy).</p>
<p>The fact is, after all this time, you haven&rsquo;t received the help you need â€“ or think you need. And worse yet, you&rsquo;re not sure you&rsquo;ve outgrown or overcome your ADHD because now you physically need Adderall. You&rsquo;ve become addicted to the drug. You can&rsquo;t even get off it to find out if you&rsquo;re ailment has left you.</p>
<h2><strong>WITH ADDERALL TODAY, AN EDUCATION IS NEEDED</strong></h2>
<p>Doctors and health providers <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/blog/doctors-addiction-training">need to understand the dangers of these prescription drugs</a>, Adderall notwithstanding. That there is a strong chance a patient will become addicted in the future if they aren&rsquo;t already.</p>
<p>For the parents, find out all you can about Adderall and its uses and basic warning signs. As for doctors, they should explain to the parents and the patient the dangers of Adderall and addiction.</p>
<p>As for the patient, help prevent addiction by reducing your use of Adderall as quickly as possible. Use other therapies such as exercise and healthy eating to help mitigate your use.</p>
<p>Be diligent and aware of your situation. Your family and friends want you healthy as soon as possible.</p>
